      <p class="mg10-3-p">
        With easily configurable magnetic force, the OnRobot MG10 gripper offers
        adjustable force to ideally match challenging application requirements
        such as destacking metal sheets one at a time. A built-in proximity
        sensor detects if a part has been picked up or not, and multi-magnet
        setups support applications that require reliable handling of large or
        heavy work pieces. And for safe, collaborative operation, the gripper
        maintains its hold on work pieces even in the case of power loss or
        emergency stop.
        <br />
        The affordable MG10 requires no external air supply or cables, for fast,
        easy installation and no additional costs. Like the rest of OnRobot’s
        family of no-fuss, all-electric grippers, the MG10 uses the Quick
        Changer and OnRobot’s intuitive programming for fast easy setup.
        <br />
        MG10 is ideal for unusually shaped parts as well as large flat metal
        sheets. Unlike vacuum grippers, the OnRobot magnetic gripper leaves no
        marks and can handle perforated, abrasive, or dusty work pieces. In
        press-tending and bending applications, the MG10 can manage a part
        throughout the entire process, even as the part changes shape.
