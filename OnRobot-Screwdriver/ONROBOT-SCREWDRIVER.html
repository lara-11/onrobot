            <h1 class="on-screw-3-h1">The OnRobot Screwdriver Advantages and Features</h1>
            <div class="on-screw-3-line"></div>

            <p class="on-screw-3-p">Automated screwdriving to boost productivity and quality has never been easier, smarter, or more cost-effective. The OnRobot intelligent Screwdriver speeds setup and programming, with everything you need right out of the box. Simply mount the Screwdriver on any leading robot arm and install the appropriate bit, then enter screw length and torque directly into the robotâ€™s user interface. Precise torque control and embedded axis eliminate the time and cost for additional integration and ensures consistent, accurate screw insertion. Changeovers to a different screw type or size take just minutes, reducing downtime and boosting ROI.
            <br>
            The OnRobot Screwdriver and available screw feeders handle a wide range of screw sizes from M1.6 to M6 and up to 50mm long. Precise torque control ranges from 0.15 Nm to 5 Nm. More versatile and intelligent than traditional tools, the OnRobot Screwdriver can detect if the screw is picked, is the correct length or been properly inserted during the tightening process. 
            <br>
            The OnRobot Screwdriver includes protective functions that make it appropriate for collaborative applications for screws up to 35mm long, which are fully retracted into the Screwdriver while in motion. Safety stop is automatically activated if a screw is exposed to excessive force along its axis, with alert lighting to indicate the issue.
