            <p class="vgp20-p">VGP20 is the world’s most powerful electric vacuum gripper, with payloads up to 20kg (44.1 lbs) and none of the cost, complexity, and maintenance of pneumatic grippers. The VGP20 is ideal for palletizing cardboard boxes, including those made with thinner, more porous recycled cardboard, as well as bulky and irregularly shaped shipping bags. That helps shippers save even more, while also reducing waste.</p>

            <div class="vgp20-3-line"></div>

            <p class="vgp20-3-p">With payloads up to 20kg (44.1 lbs), the OnRobot VGP20 is the world’s most powerful electric vacuum gripper. It is ideal for quickly and cost-effectively automating the palletizing of cardboard boxes, as well as handling bulky, porous, and irregularly shaped objects. The VGP20 allows unlimited customization, so it can automate a wide range of applications that traditionally required pneumatic grippers, but at a fraction of the cost and complexity. The VGP20 can save up to 90% on operating and maintenance costs compared to traditional pneumatic gripper deployments. 
            <br>
            Like all of OnRobot’s grippers, the VGP20 comes complete with everything needed for fast, easy deployment with any leading robot. Built-in intelligence and easy-to-use software provide precise air-flow control and the ability to vary the grip to match the application and type of material being handled, including multiple items of different shapes and sizes. The powerful vacuum flow means that it can pick up even porous objects, such as thinner, less-expensive or recycled cardboard or lightweight shipping bags, which can help shippers save even more, while also reducing waste. 
            <br>
            An option allows continuous monitoring of the gripper’s air flow. If the vacuum is interrupted for any reason, the robot will come to an immediate halt and an alert pop-up window will be displayed in the gripper software.
