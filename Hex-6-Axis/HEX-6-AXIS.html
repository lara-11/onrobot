            <div class="hex-6-line"></div>

            <p class="hex-6-p">OnRobot 6-axis force torque sensors provide accurate force and torque measurements along all 6 axes. This gives you precise control when it comes to difficult assembly, polishing, sanding or deburring jobs. Additionally, the HEX software includes path recording, force control and special features for insertion tasks. This means reduced integration time for your production line. Our sensors are designed to fit most of the current industrial robot arms. Common applications are polishing, sanding, deburring, grinding and assembly, but it can also be used for teach-in and crash detection.

            <div class="hex-6-3-line"></div>

            <p class="hex-6-3-p">Designed to fit all major robot brands, OnRobot’s HEX 6-axis force/torque sensor offers 6 degrees of force and torque measurement.  This makes the HEX 6-axis force/torque sensor perfect for complex sanding, deburring, or assembly operations, as it gives you precise control over your end-of-arm tooling’s applied force. The sensor is especially ideal for surface finishing tasks, because it ensures a constant speed and force is kept throughout the finishing. The constant force allows the finishing tool to follow the surface contours of the work piece, leading to a flawless result. Thus, by adding the OnRobot HEX 6-axis force/torque sensor into your production line, you will gain optimization and productivity advantages without compromising the quality of your solutions.
