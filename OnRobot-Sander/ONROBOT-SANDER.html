            <h1 class="on-sander-3-h1">The OnRobot Sander Advantages and Features</h1>
            <div class="on-sander-3-line"></div>

            <p class="on-sander-3-p">The OnRobot Sander comes with everything you need to get started right away: plug-and-play sanding tool, a variety of standard sanding and polishing discs, easy-to-use software, and optional automated Grit Changer and force torque sensor. What you don’t need is a noisy and expensive air compressor for this economical electric sander. 
            <br>
            Use this flexible tool for a wide range of part geometries and materials to get greater consistency, higher finish quality, and lower scrap rate. You’ll reduce workplace dust due to the use of standard 3M clean sandpaper discs and reduce the risk of worker injury from the vibration of manual sanders.
            <br>
            Programming for simple surface treatments can be completed with basic robot knowledge—no additional training required. The sanding tool’s software is automatically integrated into the robot’s teach pendant, but a manual “save position” button on the tool allows for even easier waypoint settings, without using the teach pendant. The Sander software comes with different path planning options - path from handguide, shape and points, and allows users to adjust rotation speed, optimizing cycle time and consistency.  
            <br>
            All of the advanced features of the OnRobot Sander are supported on Universal Robots arms, but the tool is easily integrated with any major robot brand.
